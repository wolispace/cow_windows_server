  --low-priority-updates 
                      INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE has lower priority than selects
  --master-host=name  Master hostname or IP address for replication. If not
                      set, the slave thread will not be started. Note that the

  --master-user=name  The username the slave thread will use for authentication
                      when connecting to the master. The user must have FILE
                      privilege. If the master user is not set, user test is
                      assumed. The value in master.info will take precedence if

                      The value in master.info will take precedence if it can
                      be read
  --master-connect-retry=# 
                      The number of seconds the slave thread will sleep before
                      retrying to connect to the master in case the master goes
                      down or the connection is lost.
  --master-retry-count=# 
                      The number of tries the slave will make to connect to the
                      master before giving up.

                      replication
  --sporadic-binlog-dump-fail 
                      Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of

  --replicate-do-db=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      specified database. To specify more than one database,
                      use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
                      Note that this will only work if you do not use
                      cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
                      SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
                      database. If you need cross database updates to work,
                      make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
  --replicate-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      specified table. To specify more than one table, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-do-db.
  --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
                      specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
                      updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
                      and whose table names start with bar
  --replicate-ignore-db=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      database. To specify more than one database to ignore,
                      use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
                      This option will not work if you use cross database
                      updates. If you need cross database updates to work, make
                      sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%. 
  --replicate-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      table. To specify more than one table to ignore, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-datbase updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-ignore-db.
  --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
                      that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
                      than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
                      to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
                      table names start with bar.
  --replicate-rewrite-db=name 
                      Updates to a database with a different name than the
                      original. Example:
                      replicate-rewrite-db=master_db_name->slave_db_name
  --report-host=name  Hostname or IP of the slave to be reported to to the
                      master during slave registration. Will appear in the
                      output of SHOW SLAVE HOSTS. Leave unset if you do not
                      want the slave to register itself with the master. Note
                      that it is not sufficient for the master to simply read
                      the IP of the slave off the socket once the slave
                      connects. Due to NAT and other routing issues, that IP
                      may not be valid for connecting to the slave from the
                      master or other hosts.
  --report-user=name  Undocumented
  --report-password=name 
                      Undocumented
  --report-port=#     Port for connecting to slave reported to the master
                      during slave registration. Set it only if the slave is
                      listening on a non-default port or if you have a special
                      tunnel from the master or other clients to the slave. If
                      not sure, leave this option unset.

                      If set, setting SQL_LOG_BIN to a value will automatically
                      set SQL_LOG_UPDATE to the same value and vice versa.

  --binlog_cache_size=# 
                      The size of the cache to hold the SQL statements for the

                      value, the more words will be put in one sort bucket.

                      Don't start more than this number of threads to handle
