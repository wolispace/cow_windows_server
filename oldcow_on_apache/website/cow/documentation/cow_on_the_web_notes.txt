cow on the web notes
----------------------------------
Add commands to the commands table as the are passed &id=34&loc=98&cmd=put the cat on the chair
actor=34
loc=98
command=put the cat on the chair

When processing the commands one by one:
1) find first command with the oldest add_date > 0
2) update it with add_date = 0 so noone else messes with this
3) find action from command
4) based on the action, determin other components (put requires a target and a second and a hosthow
5) if all params comply then continue otherwise  add msg in $loc that $actor could not $command $action_error_msg
6) manipulate the objects as per the action adding msgs as per the action (usually $actor $actioned $target $extra $second)
7) dont worry about deleting the old command as an admin function will clean these up

When reading messages:
1) use the last_message_read_datetime from the calling browser and return all msgs in their localtion or global msgs
2) The browser will interpret the ID numbers into object names - if same as $id then insert (you)

Object definition:
Names:
What used to be known as the 'name' of an object (chair, mouse, cat etc.. ) is now the 'class'. 
We will now have several objects in the room of the same class (3 chairs) however one might be white, another black etc..)
If you name something you get a white chair called Bob or a player called Frank
When building the names for an object.. randomly choose 'named, called, known as...
Special named objects simply use the name as well - 'sword of the wind, bow of might' - dropping the 'called' if the name starts with 'of '

Owners:
Objects can be owned.. this is like a link and replaces the qty with the owners name infront of the objects - if there is only one of it then the qty is ignored:
- Wallace's small mouse
- The bedroom door (???)
- Frank's gold coins

Descriptions:
Objects have a full description constructed for them and updated each time they are used in a command.
This saves having to generate this each time and is used in searches for specific classes of objects:
- get the small white cat   = find obj  in same location as the actor with words 'small' and 'white' with a class of 'cat'
