concepts about Perl and COW

one script to get user input and put it in a cue of tasks
one script to to process cue of tasks (loops) (auto starts if not running)
one script to displat current location/msgs


cow heart - loops processing tasks
- generates pages of al current active players locations
- player simply gets it displayed to them
- generates pages of active msgs

The cow heart processes all in its current cue of tasks then waits 1 seconds before checking 
for an udpated stack.  F new commands are added to the stack then it does them straight away.

All actions that take place in a location, have that location described in a file:

Location file names and structure:
123.loc - described objects with their numbers encoded (but not shown) so it can be personalised

45 a small white mouse 
wearing
384 a leather jacket
beside
45 the mouse
is 
28 a box 
with
398 some wooden dice
inside

Or indicate relationships with nesting:
45 a small while mouse
	wearing
	384 a leather jacket
	beside
	28 a box 
		inside
		398 some wooden dice

you can see a	small while mouse wearing a leather jacket.
beside the mouse is a box with some wooden dice inside.

you can see a	small while mouse (you) wearing a leather jacket.
beside you is a box with some wooden dice inside.







123.msg - a text file will all messages for that location.
